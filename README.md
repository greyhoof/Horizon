# F-Chat Horizon

This repository contains a continuation of the heavily customized F-Chat Rising, a version of the mainline F-Chat 3.0 client.

## Features

In a non-exhaustive list, F-Chat Horizon has these features!

- **Profile matching** automatically compares your profile with others to determine with whom you are compatible.
- **Automatic ad posting** repeatedly posts and rotates ads on selected channels.
- **Link previews** popup shows a preview of an image / video when you hover your mouse over a link.
- **Caching** speeds up profile loads and other actions.
- **Smart filters** let you choose what kind of ads and posts you see in the chat.

## Goals

F-Chat Horizon aims to be an opinionated fork of F-Chat Rising. Instead of aiming solely to be a more customized fork of the original client, we aim to:

- Set a sound foundation for further forks, with different goals.
- Enforce code-quality standards
- Aim to be progressive in functionality.
  - Additional functionality should be optional.
- Maintain the *core* functionality from **Rising**.

While more features will be added, we aim to not deviate *too* heavily from the original client as to avoid feature-creep.

# Installing

F-chat Rising can be installed on all *major* operating systems (Minus BSDs.)

# Usage

## Getting started

When you first load F-Chat Horizon, you'll notice its interface is closely similar to the original client. However, note the added menus:

1. **Ad Editor**: Located underneath your profile, entering the Ad editor will open an additional menu. Here you can edit the ads you want to post!
   - Assign a 'tag' to your ads. You can use the 'post ads' function to post ads of specific tag types into specified channels.
2. **Post Ads**: Located under the Ad Editor, clicking this button will open the ad posting dialog. You can select the tags and channels for your ads.
3. **Settings**: Horizon adds additional settings under the settings button.
    - *The Horizon tab*: Contains general settings for Horizon
    - *The Smart Filters tab*: Here you can configure the smart filters. **Be aware that this is a work in progress!**

## Wiki

The (currently work in progress and non-existing at this current moment) wiki has additional information on using Horizon

## FAQ:

1. The more information you have in your profile (**non-custom** kinks in particular), the better the matching quality will be. The algorithm considers the following data points:
   - Age
   - Gender
   - Sexual preference
   - Dominance preference
   - Human/anthro preference
   - Post length preference
   - Position preference
   - Non-custom kinks
   - Species
1. Matching for non-binary genders relies on kinks. For example, if your non-binary character has a preference for females, make sure 'females' are listed as a favorite kink.
   - Similarly if you want to match with non-binary genders -- independent of your characters' gender -- add your preferred non-binary types into your kink list.
2. 'Older characters' and 'younger characters' kink preferences are interpreted as age difference of 8+ years.
3. Comparison results will get faster over time, as more and more character data is cached.
4. If you have a species-fluid character (e.g. you play both your character as both a human and an anthro), you can indicate this by setting your **species** in your character profile in the following ways. F-List Rising will then score you against the best fitting type.
   - Human or tiger
   - Human, tiger, or dragon
   - Anthro (Horse or Tiger)
   - Dragon (Dwarf, Elf, or Human)
   - Elf (optionally vampire or dwarf)
   - Feline (optionally horse, tiger, or elf)
